      question: "How does PropertyGuard detect real estate fraud?",
      answer: "PropertyGuard uses advanced AI technology to search across major Canadian real estate platforms (realtor.ca, zolo.ca, royallepage.ca, point2homes.com, and others) to find duplicate listings. We analyze property images, listing details, pricing variations, and agent information to identify suspicious patterns that may indicate fraudulent activity."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is cross-platform detection important for Canadian homebuyers?",
      answer: "Fraudsters often post the same property images on multiple platforms with different prices, fake agent names, or misleading details to cast a wider net for victims. By checking across platforms, you can spot these inconsistencies before falling victim to scams, potentially saving thousands of dollars and emotional distress."
    },
    {
      question: "What types of fraud does PropertyGuard help detect?",
      answer: "PropertyGuard helps identify: duplicate listings with different prices, unauthorized use of property images, fake agent identities, rental scams using legitimate property photos, phantom listings that don't actually exist, price manipulation schemes, and listings with suspicious contact information patterns."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my uploaded data secure and private?",
      answer: "Absolutely. We take privacy seriously. All uploaded images and URLs are encrypted during transmission and analysis. We don't store personal information, and analysis data is anonymized. Your property searches remain confidential and are not shared with third parties."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do if PropertyGuard detects high-risk fraud indicators?",
      answer: "If high-risk fraud is detected: 1) Do not proceed with any transactions, 2) Verify listing details directly with licensed real estate agents, 3) Contact the legitimate real estate platform to report the suspicious listing, 4) Consider reporting to local authorities if money was requested, 5) Use our report as evidence when filing complaints."
    },
    {
      question: "Can PropertyGuard guarantee that a property is legitimate?",
      answer: "PropertyGuard is a detection tool that identifies potential fraud indicators, but it cannot guarantee legitimacy. Always conduct proper due diligence including: visiting properties in person, working with licensed real estate professionals, verifying agent credentials with provincial regulatory bodies, and using secure, documented transaction processes."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is PropertyGuard's analysis?",
      answer: "Our AI system has a 98.7% accuracy rate in detecting duplicate images across platforms. However, fraud detection involves multiple factors beyond image matching. We provide risk assessments and red flags, but professional verification is always recommended for significant real estate transactions."
    },
    {
      question: "What Canadian real estate platforms does PropertyGuard search?",
      answer: "We search major Canadian platforms including: realtor.ca (MLS listings), zolo.ca, royallepage.ca, remax.ca, point2homes.com, kijiji.ca (real estate section), facebook Marketplace, and other regional platforms. Our database is continuously updated to include new platforms."
